You may want to create a title of a menu that you can also click

you can set a label and then pipe in this way:

body="$body\n ðŸ”´  $host - looks down from here | color=red bash=ssh param1=$host terminal=true"

where color = red is just the color of the text

The important thing is 'bash =....'

at the right of the equal you can set any command you want.
You must also define the parameters that usually follow the command (you can check it in the terminal)
Finally!

If you want to run the command in the terminal you have to set the option 'terminal=true'
If this option is not stated the command will not run
